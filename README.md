Practice Datapack and Seed List for AA End Game

Datapack is self-explanatory, but I'll explain two features:

The "Free Nether Portal" item, and the method of getting into the end.

The "Free Nether Portal" does what it says, and places a free nether portal whenever used. In a normal run, you will already have an enter to the nether during the any% portion.

You use the second one as your blind portal, as you will likely also have this during your any% as well.

If you place the blind portal in the ring (160 blocks out in the nether, or 1280+ blocks out in the overworld), you will spawn a stronghold's portal room in front of you.

Use this to get into the end (eyes already filled of course).
