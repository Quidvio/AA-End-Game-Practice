Practice Datapack and Seed List for AA End Game

Datapack is self-explanatory, but I'll explain one features:

If you place the blind portal in the ring (160 blocks out in the nether, or 1280+ blocks out in the overworld), you will spawn a stronghold's starter with the only room being portal room with filled in eyes.

Use this to get into the end to do the End Again.
