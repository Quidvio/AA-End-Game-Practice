Practice Datapack and Seed List for AA End Game

Datapack is self-explanatory, but I'll explain two features:

If you place the blind portal in the ring (160 blocks out in the nether, or 1280+ blocks out in the overworld), you will spawn a stronghold's starter with the only room being portal room with filled in eyes.

Use this to get into the end to do the End Again.

The Seed List filters for an AA spawn (not jungle/taiga/forest) near desert, with an Outpost within 32RD of spawn, and a Monument and Village within 32RD of the Outpost. Ocean/River near spawn is not filtered for.
